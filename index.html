            <h2>Company Info</h2>
            <p>Our company first began in a tiny store along the lemoore, california downtown strip. We sold animals and feed to all our customers and put much practice into improving our capabilities and continuing our mission to provide the best care for our animals and all of yours. In 2011, we began to expand our company from one tiny shop to a massive branch of several hundreds of franchises top provide our services to a much larger clientele. Even now, we continue to provide the best care and the best quality to our clients and their furry, fuzzy, feathery, or any other type of family that they have taken in, as well as introduce some of those friends to new family who can give them a proper home and proper love.</p>
