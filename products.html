            <h3>Miguel the dog</h3>
            <img src="migueldog.jpg" alt="Young tan dog named miguel">
            <p>Miguel is a 2 year old pug/shih tzu mix breed who was brought in when his previous owners left him behind. He was found in terrible shape, fleas, matted, hair and very wary of human interaction. But, thanks to our efforts we have managed to rehabilitate him and give him another chance to find a forever home to take him in. He is a joyful and excitable pup who is searching for new better owners to take him in, he has all his shots, and has been neutered.</p>
            <h3>Kirsten the cat</h3>
            <img src="kirstencat.jpg" alt="Grey chartreux cat">
            <p>Kirsten was a stray that was brought in. She has been spayed and is estimated to be around 5 or so years old. We suspect she had a litter before joining us, but had found no traces of the kittens she may have had while out in the streets. She was given proper care when she was brought in. She is a warm and affectionate kitten who is in need of a new home to live out her time in and a new family to bond with.</p>
